GeoGami, is a relaxing shape-flippling geometry puzzle game. The goal of the game is to fill in the oragami shaped level by flip geometry pieces to fill in the level. 

Geogami is a Gamkedo club game I assisted on near the end of the project. I implemented so bug fixes and added menu and level UI and UI animations to help add polish and bring the game over the line to completion.
