At the start of 2018 I did a intro to [Substance Painter](https://www.allegorithmic.com/products/substance-painter) course from pluralsight. [Stylized Texturing in Substance Painter](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/stylized-texturing-substance-painter-2389/table-of-contents) t's pretty thorough and complete. The course instructor is [Dan John Cox](https://danjohncox.com), Senior Artist at Blizzard Entertainment.

I manage to complete the course in the 10 day free trial on plural sight. So If you don't have a subscription and have a week of dedication. You can still benifit greatly from this course if you'r wanting to learn Substance painter 2018.

Here's my final render after the course.
