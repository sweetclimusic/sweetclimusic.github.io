For the month of April (2019) I've been learning iOS ARkit. I've been learning it both natively and view unity. I wanted to try out the new (to me) .USDZ files and AR Quick look after learning about the workflow from a title of a meetup event for leeds digital festival 2019. Like the good developer I am, figured I could experiment myself instead of going to a talk on the subject.
