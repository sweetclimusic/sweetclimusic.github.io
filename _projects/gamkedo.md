GeoGami, is a relaxing shape-flippling geometry puzzle game. The goal of the game is to fill in the oragami shaped level by flip geometry pieces to fill in the level. 

I implemented so bug fixes and added menu and level UI and UI animations to help add polish and bring the game over the line to completion.

In-the-Zone,  one-on-one basketball game you play in the browser. Be the first to control all zones before the shot clock reaches zero. Play against a friend with local multiplayer or against cpu player.

I created a mini JS Vector 2 Math library to calculate rebounding of the ball for rim shots. I did the final designed of the basketball court and background crowd.
